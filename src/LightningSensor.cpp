  Qwiic Digital Lightning Sensor AS3935 SPI and I2C Breakout Kit
  https://www.playingwithfusion.com/productview.php?pdid=135&catid=1012

  **Product Description**
  Breakout board for the AS3935 digital lightning sensor based on the AMS reference design. Includes specially tuned antenna, SPI or I2C interfacing, and a wide 2.4V to 5.5V standard operating range. This innovative sensor is designed to interface with most current development systems and boards, including all current Arduino modules. The breakout board features an inductor (antenna) specially designed for this application, and the board ships fully calibrated. This ensures that you donâ€™t have to write a massive back-end to support low-level IC calibration, just focus on your final application!

  We store calibration values for each board shipped. The calibration value (in pF) is written on the lower corner of the product label. This information can also be provided at your request by contacting Technical Support and referencing your original order number.
